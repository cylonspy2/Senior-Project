Hit the start button to start the game

Fish play music as they come into the scene, and props modify that music in some way.

The bottom bar shows all the fish you can select. if you click on the fish bubble, it switches out for the props menu.
The props menu gives you a list of all the props you can place. 
Selecting a prop from the menu enables you to place that prop on the colorful gravel ground. 
The darker the ground, the more powerful the effect it will have on the space.

Hit escape to open the pause menu so you can exit the game and reset the scene.
